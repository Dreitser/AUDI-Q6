## Audi’s Commitment to Innovation  
Innovation and technology are central to Audi's DNA. In 2017, Audi introduced a mixed-reality experience with HoloLens, merging animated 3D objects with real-world surroundings. Fast forward to 2023, Audi integrated Apple Vision Pro into their Virtual Exhibit to offer an immersive experience of the fully electric Audi Q6 e-tron.  

### Key Requirements for the Experience:  
1. **Technical Accuracy** – Clearly convey the product's features.  
2. **High-Quality Resources** – Deliver reusable content for media professionals.  

The Virtual Exhibit XR showcased every detail of the Q6 e-tron, from its luxurious design to intricate technical features like the rear electric motor's oil cooling circuit, all in real-time 3D.
